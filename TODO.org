* Tracer

May be a good idea to start with vulkan, as gfx-rs seems kindof goofy
right now to me, and vulkan may prove very useful when implementing a
gpu pathtracer.

** TODO Render a triangle

** NEXT Render a cube with camera movement

** NEXT Load an .obj file and render all triangles of an object

** NEXT Load a .mtl file and render an object with basic material
   Only consider diffuse color to start with.

** NEXT Use Embree and implement a basic raytracer
   Direct illumination, basic materials, and no bounces.

** NEXT Implemente more complete pathtracer
   Support reflection, refraction, and transmission. Dielectric and metallic materials.

   Should at this point be able to render something like this

   or this

** NEXT Handle light being composed of different colors
   Should be able to recreate Chromatic Abberation when transmitting through a glass sphere, for example.

** NEXT Light attenuation. Colored transmitting mediums. Sunglasses, colored glass, colored plastic.

** NEXT More cool pathtracing features. Caustics?

** NEXT GPU pathtracing. Use vulkan?

** NEXT Real-time pathtracing
   Reprojection? Consider other hacks for making it all faster.

** NEXT Real-time pathtraced game
